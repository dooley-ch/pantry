# Pantry

![Shopping](resources/shopping.jpg)

This application can be used to manage your home food inventory.  The main objective of the application is to let you know your 
stock levels.  The application consists of two programs: a website that manages all the data and provides a web based interface to
the application.  And a client application that can be placed near the pantry or other storage area and be used to scan the receipt and 
withdrawal of product items.  It can be run on a Raspberry PI or a Raspberry PI Zero.
